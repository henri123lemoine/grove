# TODO

- Prune
    - [ ] **Confirmation before prune**: Prune runs immediately without confirmation
    - [ ] **Visual feedback after prune**: Show how many entries were pruned
- [ ] **Delete branch after worktree deletion**: Option to also delete the branch when removing worktree
- [ ] **Sorting options for worktree list**: Sort by name, date, dirty status, etc.
- [ ] **Create worktree at specific commit/tag**: Currently only supports branches
- [ ] **Shell quoting for paths with spaces**: Template expansion doesn't quote paths
