# TODO

- [ ] Creating a new worktree in the popup should create a new window
    Or is this already an option I haven't set properly?
- [ ] Associatedly, if I select a worktree that exists but for which a tmux window doesn't exist, it seems to do nothing, rather than creating a tmux window and going there.
- [ ] Is the layout functionality working at all?
