# TODO

- Prune
    - [x] **Confirmation before prune**: Prune runs immediately without confirmation
    - [x] **Visual feedback after prune**: Show how many entries were pruned
- [x] **Delete branch after worktree deletion**: Option to also delete the branch when removing worktree
- [x] **Sorting options for worktree list**: Sort by name, date, dirty status, etc.
- [ ] **Create worktree at specific commit/tag**: Currently only supports branches
- [x] **Shell quoting for paths with spaces**: Template expansion doesn't quote paths
